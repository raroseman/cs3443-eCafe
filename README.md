ATTENTION:
Please download MySQL here -> http://www.mysql.com/downloads/ <-
We'll need it to hold menu items. Also, if you take a look at
the .classpath file for the project, you'll see that it points
to a .jar file that you don't have. Installing MySQL to the default
location on your system should fix any errors you see from that.
